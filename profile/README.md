## Hi there 👋, we are launching our app named [Wind](https://wind.app)

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
-->

Wind is a decentralised banking replacement built by self-custodial on-chain wallets that facilitate instant, almost free, global payments. We are bringing a familiar Web2 UI running on Web3 technologies, giving the masses access to instant payments, high yield stablecoin strategies, and access to digital assets.
